	<h1>about me</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>my name is carl, my major is computer science, i'm a senior</li>
		<li>i am a senior in computer science and i'm taking this class for the hci pillar course</li>
		<li>i have experience in html/css/js. I have done cse 330 rapid prototyping and cse 204 intro to web dev</li>
		<li>i hope to learn more about the design aspect, like how to build good and intuitive websites.</li>
		<li>screens have different sizes, and as a designer one must think about all the different sizes. one design must accommodate for all those sizes.</li>
		<li>I think apple.com is a website with effective design. on larger screens it presents information well and on smaller screens it adapts well and shows its full animations and information well.</li>
		<li>The architecture of doom.org website: https://architectureofdoom.org/ I believe represents effective communication. It is a archive site, and when you open it, it shows a map with dots where you could choose from. Its very easy and fast for the user to choose what they want to look and for the organization to showcase its collections.</li>
		<li>I think wustl's class registrar website works quite well: https://registrar.washu.edu/classes-registration/class-schedule-search/. The design is very popping and it has a very clearly indicated filter box with clear information about each course like section, term, instructor and info.</li>
