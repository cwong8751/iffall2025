        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Take chicken out of fridge and remove the frost</li>
            <li>Cut chicken into bite sized pieces and heat a wok</li>
            <li>Add oil and fry the chicken until its brown.</li>
            <li>Cut potato into small pieces, about 1 inch squares and 1/2 inch thick and keep in a bowl of water until ready to use. Cut the onion and tomato to a large dice. Mince the ginger and garlic. Cut the chorizo into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Add more oil, swirl around, and add the potatoes. Stir fry until lightly browned and starting to soften. Set aside. </li>
            <li>Add more oil, swirl around, and add the onion. Stir fry until starting to soften, then add garlic and ginger. Stir fry another minute and add the turmeric, cumin, and paprika. Stir together and cook briefly. Add the chicken stock, coconut milk, and evaporated milk. Add the tomato, chorizo, and bay leaf and return the potatoes and chicken to the pan.

        <h3>Recipe websites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://gingerandchorizo.wordpress.com/2012/08/30/galinha-portuguesa-portuguese-chicken/">Ginger and Chorizo recipe website</a> This website seems to be a recipe site that also doubles as a personal blog. It has a very minimalist look and dives straight into the recipe with two paragraphs of personal story behind the dish. The page was text heavy and has little images. The images seem to be stock, and does not show any process between different steps of the recipe. </li>
            <li><a href="https://whatsheate.com/bacalhau-macau-1516">What she ate recipe site</a> This site is more of a traditional recipe site, it has lots of information about the dish including cook times, calorie information. One best thing about this site is that it has a whole section dedicated to nutritional facts, showing detail information about the dish. However, the site also has alot of other promotional information that is not relevant to the core part of the site. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/cold-brew-coffee/">Budget Bytes</a> This site has a quite clean design with bold and easy to read font. Although it has a bunch of placeholder paragraphs at the start it does have a "jump to recipe" button. The recipe is also formatted in a very clear way with popping colors and good layout. I think its probably the best site out of the three. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Non-recipe websites</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> I think this one is an all time classic. There is a reason why wikipedia didnt change its layout over all these years. The information is structured clearly and easy to find, and information is really detailed. However, the only downside is probably the fact that its quite text heavy, and the layout isnt as flexible as other types of websites. </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/">Zillow/Zillow Apartments</a>I have been using this one for quite a while to find my next apartment. The map + sidebar overlay works really well and lets you understand the location and the house's info really quickly to help you make decisions. The only downsides is that sometimes the interactions dont feel as fluid as they should. </li>
            <li><a href="https://eicoinc.com/">Eico Inc</a> This is a small design agency in China and their website is really interesting. It has a really clear tagline of what they do and what their goal is, followed by their portfolio, which is quite important for a design agency. The way they present their information in a grid-like view is clear for the viewer and also showcases their capabilities. One downside is that it takes quite a long scroll if the viewer just want contact information (its at the bottom of the page). </li>
